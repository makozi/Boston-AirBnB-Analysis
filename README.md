# Boston AirBnB Analysis

The Boston AirBnB Analysis has the listing activity of homestays in Boston, MA.

### Data

The data used in this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston)

The following Airbnb activity is included in this Boston dataset:

1. Listings, including full descriptions and average review score

2. Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments

3. Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day


This project answers the following questions:

1. Is there a spatial discrepancy in price based on neighborhood?

2. What is the seasonality of price in Boston?


## Installation

Open the notebook on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/makozi/Boston-AirBnB-Analysis/blob/master/Boston_Airbnb.ipynb)

### Question 1: Is there a spatial discrepancy in price based on neighborhood?

1.  The ones which are affordable look like rooms either in a dorm or a shared room of an apartment.
    
2.  More expensive neighborhoods are downtown which intuitively makes sense.
    
3.  The expensive AirBnBs farther away from Downtown are usually multiple bedrooms and bathrooms and possibly full-size mansions.


### Question 2: What is the price seasonality in Boston? What month is most affordable/expensive? Day of the week?

1.  We can see the months of September and October are the most expensive months to visit Boston and stay in an AirBnB. We can also see the price drops sharply during after these periods as it becomes colder. The cheapest time appears to be February.

2.  It appears you want to visit Boston on a Weekday to get the best deal which makes sense because majority of people will be at work during this time. However, difference between the mean of a weekend price and a weekday price is less than 10 dollars or 5% of total cost.
